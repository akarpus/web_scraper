web-scraper
===============

Simple web scraper that parses a URL's html source code (using Jsoup library) into readable, plain text code which is later read into a stream and displayed. Wikipedia's articles are nicely displayed so decided to hardcode it for now. Hoping to come back to this at some point and use this as template to convert large sums of aggregate stock/financial data from Google or Yahoo and do something it.
